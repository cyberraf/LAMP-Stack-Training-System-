# LAMP-Stack-Training-System-
Building a system for the DoD military personnel to take courses

**Project:** For the purpose of this project, we suppose we own a company **TarbariTech Inc._**, and we have won a contract to support the Department of Defense (DoD). The contract requires **_TarbariTech Inc._** to develop a cloud-based system to support the military personal training. The system will process, store, and transmit Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), and payment card information. We have chosen to leverage a L.A.M.P(Linux, Apache, MySQL,PHP) Stack for the development of the system.
