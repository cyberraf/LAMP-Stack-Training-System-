# LAMP-Stack-Training-System-
Building a system for the DoD military personnel to take courses

**Project Description:** For the purpose of this project, we suppose we own a company **TarbariTech Inc._**, and we have won a contract to support the Department of Defense (DoD). The contract requires **_TarbariTech Inc._** to develop a cloud-based system to support the military personal training. The system will process, store, and transmit Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), and payment card information. We have chosen to leverage a L.A.M.P(Linux, Apache, MySQL,PHP) Stack for the development of the system.

For the planning, documentation, development, and monitoring of the system, we are going to follow the [NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-37r2.pdf).

The NIST RMF will help us manage the system we ar edeveloping from inception to disposal, in short the System Developement Lifecycle (SDLC). The definition provided by NIST is "_RMF provides a comprehensive, flexible, repeatable, and measurable 7-step process that any organization can use to manage information security and privacy risk for organizations and systems and links to a suite of NIST standards and guidelines to support implementation of risk management programs to meet the requirements of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)._"
